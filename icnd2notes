___VTP-Pruning___
basically makes it so traffic only traverses to switches that have ports in the vlan. So un-needed traffic is not traversed over the network.
conf t; int fa 1/0/1; switchport trunk pruning vlan 3-9; configure manually
conf ;t int fa 1/0/2; switchport trunk vlan allowed 3-9; only allow certain vlan traffic also
switch#vtp pruning; enable it one device
valid vlans for pruning are 2-1001

____ETHERCHANNEL______
layer 2&3 treat etherchannel bundles as a single link
etherchannel port channel logical interface, only 1-48 allowed
links must have the same speed,duplex, and vlan config
PAgp-Cisco's proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol, uses auto or desireable commands 
sends packets every 30 seconds to manage consistency

LACP- Link Aggregation Control Protocol, uses active and passive command
channel-group- command on ethernet interfaces used to add int to a single etherchannel
int port-channel- command that creates a bundled interface

[EXAMPLE]  [LACP] [BEGIN]
int range g0/1-2;switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q; switchport mode trunk- create your trunks for etherchannel
channel-group 1 mode active; exit;     what mode you choose creates lacp or pagp
(config)int port-channel 1;
(config-if)switchport mode trunk encapsulation dot1q;swtichport mode trunk; switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,2,3;
all commands performed at the port-channel int are inherited at the interface level

int range g0/13-14;switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q; switchport mode trunk-other side connections
channel-group 1 mode active; exit;
(config)int port-channel 1;
(config-if)switchport mode trunk encapsulation dot1q;swtichport mode trunk; switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,2,3;
all commands performed at the port-channel int are inherited at the interface level of all ports assigned to channel
if you wanted to change the config from layer 2 access ports to trunk you would configure at:int port-channel 1;
sh etherchannel port-channel
sh etherchannel summary
[example] [lacp] [end]

[EXAMPLE] [Layer3etherchannel] [Begin]
You would use for connecting multiple ports on a swtich to a router

R(config)int port-channel 1- creates port channel int
R(config-if)ip address 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0
R(config-if)int range g0/0-1;channel-group 1;- adds both interfaces to port channel group
sh run- will not show ip address under these int will show channel-group 1
int port-channel1 will show ip address and load interval

layer 3 on a switch
s1(config) int port-channel 5;s1(config-if)no switchport;ip address 10.100.100.1 255.255.255.0

____Dynamic Arp Inspection____
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/dynarp.html good example
either way works
(config)ip arp inspection vlan 10,11,12; ip arp inspection vlan 10-12;ip arp inspection vlan 10-15,18;
you can create trusted interface so the inspection does not occur and switch forwards arp frame as usual
(config-if)ip arp inspectoin trust
show arp access-list;   displays arp acls
show ip arp inspection interfaces [id]; displays trust state and arp rate limit on the specified or on all
show ip arp inspection vlan; displays configuration and the operation od DAI for the specified vlan. if no vlan id then on all

____FHRP___HSRP____
both interfaces need thier own local interface on same subnet to communicate hello messages
so the hsrp ip is the ip between the two routers in this situation you have 3 ips allocated to routers
conf t;int fa0/0;standby 1 ip 10.1.1.10;standby 1 name HSRPTest;standby 1 priority 110;standy 1 preempt;		-higher priority wins
Same HSRP config goes on the other gateway. Both use .10 as virtual ip so hosts wont even know which router they are using
do show standby		- get all your basic data for trouble shooting
do show standby brief		- quick and simple one liner but has basically everything you need
debug standby		-get all standby info to screen

____EIGRP___ipv4____
http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=27839&seqNum=3
Neighbors need: SAME AS, int in EIGRP process, K values same,	
hello and dead timers are not critical with EIGRP
Enhanced interior gateway routing protocol
conf t;router eigrp 20;		- 20 gives you your AS number all routers in this as need to be given the same AS
(config-router)network 10.10.11.0 0.0.0.255;	use wild card to distinguish specific network 10.10.11
(config-router)network 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.3; block of 4 net .0 b-cast .3 hosts .1&.2  very small network in AS point to point links
(config-router)network 172.16.10.4 0.0.0.3; just reminder that thats a whole differenct subnet and would need to be added individually
(config-router)network 10.0.0.0;	all networks in the 10. on this device are part of eigrp 20
(config-router)network 172.16.0.0;	all networks associated with class B are part of eigrp 20
router eigrp 20; no auto-summary;	usually your not going to want eigrp to summarize for you. can cause problems, especially in discontiguous nets
with auto summary on eigrp it sends out classful network info. Classless requires: no auto-;
passive-interface g0/1;		stops the interface from sending and receiveiving hello messages and bringing up eigrp but this does not stop other interfaces
from advertising this subnet under this interface. You would need to use wildcards and ensure this subnet is not under the eigrp at all.
neighbor 172.16.10.2;	router will now use unicast for updates with neighbor instead of multicast
maximum-paths ?;	older ios 16 max paths newer ios 32 maximal paths stored in database, by default eigrp supports 4 paths load balancing
Changing the K values
(config-router)# metric wights 1 0 1 0 0; always1, bandwidth/load, delay, reliability, MTU
Authentication:(config-if)#key chain vault;key 1;key-string Welcome;ip authentification mode eigrp 1 md5;
(config-if)#ip authentification key-chain eigrp 1 vault;
sh ip protocols;	shows information about active protocol sessions, will show you  your eigrp AS and k values, hold time
sh ip eigrp topology;	shows entries in the eigrp topology table
sh ip eigrp traffic;	shows the packet count for eigrp packets sent and received	
sh ip eigrp interfaces;		shows the interfaces on which the router has actually enabled eigrp
sh ip eigrp neighbors;		shows all eigrp nieghbors, their ip addy, retransmit interval, and queue counts for the adjacent routers
sh ip route eigrp;
sh ip eigrp topology all-links; if you want to see every option or else you just get S & FS
debug ip eigrp;		trouble shoot any problem you may have
undebug all; no debug ip eigrp;
sh ip eigrp 100 interfaces detail; will show you hello timers
ip hello-interval eigrp 1 8;
ip hold-time eigrp 1 20
by default hello is 5 seconds and hold is 15. The onyl place to find currentl hold time is sh run. Nothing is default, the change if changed
eigrp by default will load balance accross equal cost paths but if you want unequal cost paths load balancing you must change variance
router eigrp 20; variance 2;	will load balance to remote network up to 4 paths and the fd can be twice as large max for variance is 128 which
is 128 times the fd.
split horizon is enabled by default- basically it stops routers from sending back the updates that they received back to router they recieved them from
Feasable distance- Best metric among all paths to a remote network
RD/AD Reported distance/ advertised distance- metric of a remote network, as reported by its neighbor, second number in topololgy table parenthesis
RD/AD plus cost to get to neighbor is the feasable distance.
successor- think successful, best route to a remote network
feasable successor- back up route, inferior to successor route
Neighbor table- information about neighbors is stored in the neighbor table, which is stored in ram
topology table-populated by the neighbor table and the Diffusing update algorihm DUAL
routing table- your normal routing table, so for eigrp to work it needs all 3 tables
RTP- Reliable transport protocol, manages communication between eigrp speaking routers
hello timer by deafault is 5 seconds, hold timer is length of time a router is willing to wait before it declares its neighbor dead.
the only time it a eigrp advertises all its information is when a new nieghbor is established
sh ip route output for eigrp:[[[ D		10.0.0.0/8 [90/2195456] via 172.16.10.2, 00:27:06,Serial0/0   ]]]
D is for DUAL algo, 90 is Admin dist,2195456 is the feasable distance, everything else self explanatory
sh ip eigrp topology:
P 192.168.10.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2172416
	via 172.16.10.6 (2172416/28160), serial 0/1
	via 172.16.10.2 (3074560/28160), serial 0/0
to routes to 192.168.10.0  serial 0/1 has same RD/AD as serial 0/0 so both routes are same distance as Advrt by rtr, s0/0 has a slower connection
 so FD is higher making serial 0/1 the successor! The P means passive router has found all routes and is happy. IF P is replaced with an A it means active
eigrp is not happy and it is querying its neighbors for another route.
RTP- EIGRP communicates via RTP- reliable transport protocol, uses 224.0.0.10,Update, query,reply,hello,ack.
Diffusing Update Algorithm(DUAL)-selecting and maintaining best path to each remote network
Hello-used to discover Eigrp neighbors
ACK-sent in response up an update and it always unicast
reply-sent in response to a query via unicast method
query-request for specific routes and always uses the reliable multicast method
update-sent in response to metric up topology changes, reliable multicast. If one router needs an update then it sends it via unicast
Hold-timer- tells your neighbor how long they can wait before they declare you dead. Change your hold time to one second and your
neighbor decalres that you are dead after one second elapses. 	
Split horizon : Never advertsie a network out the interface you are using to reach that network.

224.0.0.5 P2P- multicast address ospf routers use for adjacencies, 224.0.0.6 multi-cast non P2P
to make adjancies: need same area, and same hello and dead timers. Adjancies only made to DR and BDR.
ospf router states: Down- no hello packets have formed adjaencies yet, attempt-nieghbors must be cnfigured manually (NBMA) non-broadcast multi access
init-hello packets have been received, but no router id in neighbor field, bi directional communication not set up, 2way bi-directional established, hello
included router id, and DR and BDR election can now be established.
Full- full synchronization among neighbors
RID-Highest used loopback address. If not used highest active ip on router.
Hello/ dead interval . Hello default 10. dead time is length of time allotted for hello not to be received before declaring dead
Hello and dead timers are a must for an adjacenecie or neighbor to come up!!! Especially non cisco vendors check defaults
DR-Designated router is elected whenever routers are connected to the same area, minimizes number of adjacencies formed, publicizes received routing info
to and from remaining routers in the broadcast domain. DR is won by priority level, if tied router ID.
All routers in the area form adjacencies with the DR and BDR
BDR- Backup designated router- hot standby for DR on broadcast. Receives all routing updates but does not disperse lsa, DR only.
LSA Link-State advertisement, there are 5 types:
type 1 RLA -Router link advertisement,  generated by all R,advert contains status of routers link in area of which it is connected
type 2 NLA -Network link advertisement, generated by DR, flooded  to all routers that are part of same area contains DR, BDR ip information
type 3 SLA- Summary link advertisement, generated by ABR, advertises inter-area routes to the backbone area Adv contain Rid of the ABR that is adv lsa.
type 4 LSA- like type 3 generated by ABR, specifically to adv how to get to ASBR
type 5 ELA- External link advertisement, sent by ASBR to advertise routes that are external to the OSPF AS

Dynamic Multipoint VPN
supports dynamic routing and multicast.
Next Hop Resolution Protocol NHRP 
simple config over public internet!
MGRE Multipoint General Routing Encapsulation,Next Hop Resolution Protocol NHRP, IPSec
Hub or HQ unit learns each spokes public and private addresses for routing, dynamically.
NBMA is public address
VPN addy private 
Hub is control plane for spoke-spoke connection

_________Reflexive-ACL internet connection on router_________
http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/nov/25/reflexive-access-lists/
To employ reflexive ACLs, three access lists are actually needed:
 one for inbound traffic, one for outbound traffic, and one (the reflexive ACL) to keep track of dynamic entries
On outboud interface, how our home routers work:
ip nat inside source list 1 interface Fa0/1 overload
ip access-list extended Egress
 permit ip any any reflect Mirror  !mirror reflection of packets to test with the next acl  source--->dest
ip access-list extended Ingress
 evaluate Mirror     ! After packets have been mirrored, router evaluates the mirored packets
int fa0/1;ip access-group Ingress in;ip access-group Egress out; 
access-list 1 permit any
Mirror the traffic going out so outbound ip and port become inbound ip and port. Use inbound acl to evaluate that mirror

On inside interface so that you can have a DMZ established on different routing interfaces.
int fa0/0;ip access-group Ingress in; ip access-group Egress out
ip access-list extended Egress
 evaluate Mirror
ip access-list extended Ingress
 permit ip any any reflect Mirror
!
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
make sure your nat nats the correct subnet! Mirror packets that come in fa0/0, evaluate them outgoing fa0/0 as they come back.
