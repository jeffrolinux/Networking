verify that your bond0 is active 
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0

With LACP on one switch you do not get resilience at the switch level. You will load balancing with both up. Fail safe if one of the 
cables or Nics fail.
You can run LACP with multiple switches for redundancy at later 2 but you will need stackwise or a datacenter technology to aggregate
port channel accross multiple switches.
You can use active backup if you want to use two swtiches for redundancy purposes. But you will not get load balancing. When you have a
failure on one of the ports the other will go up so you will not have your mac address places in two places at layer 2.
