					Linux routes	 tested on ubuntu I suppose anything Debian is the same.
route add -net 10.8.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.111
ip route add 10.8.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.111
ip route add 10.8.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.111 dev ens33         not necessarily needed but you can specify device
to remove: route del -net 10.8.1.0/24

3 ways to see your routing table

ip route show
route -n
netstat -rn
						Windows route 
route ADD destination_network MASK subnet_mask  gateway_ip metric_cost
mask and cost are optional   class c is the default mask, cost one greater than 0.0.0.0 is used
route ADD 10.8.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.111
by default static routes will disappear in windows typically organizations will use a batch file to update at startup
route -p ADD 10.8.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.111      -p persistent, stays until you delete it.
To remove: route delete destination_network  ie route delete 10.8.1.3
