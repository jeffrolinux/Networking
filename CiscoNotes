sh ip int brief - list a brief summary of interfaces ip information and status
conf t
configure terminal globally
(config)#
int g1/0/2   -switches are stackible and behave as a chassis  g1 stack   /0 first switch  /2 second port maybe wrong maybe firstnu
(config-if)#
configure the interface
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
Has to have no switchport configured if you are going to assign an ip address and make it a routed port
by default ports are switchports and can not and do not have an ip address

recall that if you want to undo anything you type the same command with a no before it

(Config-if-range)#          any change affects all ports in the range
switchport mode access
by default ports are not a switchport
switchport- makes a port switch access
Never use Vlan1
switchport access vlan 2

create a vlan   notes from class
conf t
interface vlan 3
ip address 10.0.253.1 255.255.255.0
do sh run | i vlan    shows you everything that is included with vlan i kinda works like grep
no shutdown- 

create vlan notes from cisco
conf t
vlan 3
name vlan3
end

put a switch interface in a vlan
conf t
int g1/0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 3  or try vlan3      #call by name or by vlan id tests these out later!!!

show vlan - see the vlans and what ports belong to them
RIP
conf t
ip routing - enables routing just incase it was disable
router rip
network 10.0.0.0       - will run rip on all 10. networks or you can specify specific network by id
neighbor 10.0.6.1   run rip with neighbor ip 

access list
ip access-list extended labacl
permit icmp any any

in configure interface
ip access-group labacl out    you choose weather in or out

turn off or on routing in switch
