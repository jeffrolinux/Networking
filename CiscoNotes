(config)#
int g1/0/2   - type/slot/port
(config-if)#  configure the interface
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
Has to have no switchport configured if you are going to assign an ip address and make it a routed port
by default ports are switchports and can not and do not have an ip address

(Config-if-range)#          any change affects all ports in the range
switchport mode access
by default ports are not a switchport
switchport- makes a port switch access
Never use Vlan1
switchport access vlan 2

create a vlan   notes from class
conf t
interface vlan 3
ip address 10.0.253.1 255.255.255.0
do sh run | i vlan    shows you everything that is included with vlan i kinda works like grep
no shutdown- 

create vlan notes from cisco
conf t
vlan 3
name vlan3
end

put a switch interface in a vlan
conf t
int g1/0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 3  or try vlan3      #call by name or by vlan id tests these out later!!!

show vlan - see the vlans and what ports belong to them
RIP
conf t
ip routing - enables routing just incase it was disable
router rip
network 10.0.0.0       - will run rip on all 10. networks or you can specify specific network by id

in configure interface
ip access-group labacl out    you choose weather in or out

turn off or on routing in switch
