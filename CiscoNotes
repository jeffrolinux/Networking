Just a starting point
enable password PasswordGoesHere
enable secret PasswordGoesHere
Use one of these and not both or you may receive odd behavior
conf t

just enable or en if it is already configured
#prompt is enable mode
?- to see any commands
do- if your in configuration mode and want to see something that should be ran in en

conf t
configure terminal globally
(config)#
int g1/0/2   -switches are stackible and behave as a chassis  g1 stack   /0 first switch  /2 second port maybe wrong maybe firstnu
(config-if)#
configure the interface
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
Has to have no switchport configured if you are going to assign an ip address and make it a routed port
by default ports are switchports and can not and do not have an ip address

recall that if you want to undo anything you type the same command with a no before it
or if your in conf and you want to check running configuration or anything you can always run the command do
do sh conf


To recover password you must console in and turn machine off and push button in the front while machine turns back on
wait until you get the special switch: terminal
then dir
rename config.text   to something you can use later so when it boots it doesn't boot your configuration
boot -next you must use the boot command to boot the ios internetwork operating system
run- command that allows you to reuse your renamed config file
enable secret myusualpass
write mem   to write new configuration to memory

configure multiple interfaces the same
conf t
int range GigabitEthernet g1/0/2 - 48
(Config-if-range)#          any change affects all ports in the range
switchport mode access
by default ports are not a switchport
switchport- makes a port switch access
Never use Vlan1
switchport access vlan 2

create a vlan   notes from class
conf t
interface vlan 3
ip address 10.0.253.1 255.255.255.0
dp sh run | i vlan    shows you everything that is included with vlan i kinda works like grep
no shutdown- 

create vlan notes from cisco
conf t
vlan 3
name vlan3
end

put a switch interface in a vlan
conf t
int g1/0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 3  or try vlan3      #call by name or by vlan id tests these out later!!!

RIP
conf t
ip routing - enables it just incase it was disable
router rip
network 10.0.0.0       - will run rip on all 10. networks or you can specify specific network by id
neighbor 10.0.6.1   run rip with neighbor ip 

access list
ip access-list extended labacl
permit icmp any any
implicit deny any any - not needed is automatic
deny ip any any log
to apply acl
in configure interface
ip access-group labacl out    you choose weather in or out

turn off or on routing in switch
conf t 
no ip routing
