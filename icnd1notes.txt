___Useful-Commands____
do sh ip int brief | i G # statement needs to start with what your including, only prints that exact line that has whats included
do sh ip int brief | begin G # begins where Gigabitinterface first line starts
do sh ip route | include 10.100.12.0   # helping fish through huge routing tables
sh access-list | i 10.1.1.1.*ssh  matching two items on a line    note .* operator
you wouldn't do sh run | i interface  G  it will only print one line instead do next line

____trouble-shooting____
_____ConfigureReplace____
enable;conf t;
archive
Router(config-archive)#path disk0:myconfig
Router(config-archive)#maximum 5 - maximum number of replacement files to have on hand
Router(config-archive)#time-period 10080  -in minutes, once a week
Router(config-archive)#archive config- saves the current running config to the archive
Router#configure replace disk0:myconfig-1

___SCP___
You will need aaa and ssh for scp to function
ip scp server enable -turn on scp server
conf t; aaa new-model-
aaa authentification login default local; aaa authorization exec default local
username myname privilege 15 password mypassword;username myname privilege 15 secret mypassword
password does not hash but you can service password-encryption which is only a simple hash thats not hard to reverse
secret takes more cpu power but I believe is a MD5 and not reverseable

__scp___
___Telnet___
to login you can use either a routed port or svi
line vty 0 15; password telnet; login
you can also do no login to allow telent sessions with no login so no password. Not secure! ALLOWS login
login local- requires username and password login just requires line password
no login- allows you to login without any password
no password- Is how you block logging in, no password set will not allow people to login
transport input none; transport input ssh- should also stop the ability of telnet from working
sh users- shows users who are logged in to local machine
clear line vty 0- where 0 is the number on the right side of vty on the session you want disconnected
sh sessions- shows connections that originated local and are outgong
disconnect 2- from the show sessions read out you can choose which sessions you want to log out
terminal monitor- allows logging to go over telnet 
terminal no monitor-turns it off

___telnet____
____IFS___

tftpdnld- command to initiate the download
#I have seen this used also with the set command and with : delimiter instead of =
# Did not work on 2851. Default and server is same address as I used X-0ver to server.
#IF you had access to a router that uses the same ios turn it into a server and remember
#you  use the first ethernet connection g0/0. Ensure you can communicate with server via
#that port

once tftpdnld is complete reset and see what you got "reset" the command

____License___
With IOS 12.? you needed specific ios to perform specific actions, with 15.? everything comes with the ios and you only need to activate
license boot module ?- use a Right-To-Use(Evaluation version)
show license -shows licenses active on system and status variables
show license feature- shows the licenses that are available on your system and status variables
show license udi- shows you your udi which consists of two components product ID and serial number of router.
show version- will also tell you various license details
You will need to transfer the license via tftp to your device
copy tftp flash: -get your license off your server to your device
license save flash:licnesename.lic- saves your license if it was transferred somewhere other than flash
license install flash:FTX16743847389473289473298.lic
license boot module c2900 technology-package securityk9- how you use a Right-To-Use(Evaluation License)
license boot module c2900 technology-package securityk9 disable- disables the license
license clear securityk9- clears the license
no license boot module c2900 technology-package securityk9 disable- gets rid of license

____license_____
___Boot/startup choices___
Default boot Post,bootstrap-ios(first ios found),startup-config, startup-config placed in ram becomes running-config.
Where the system is booted from and which ios to boot as default can be changed with the boot system command
config-register 0x2102- change the register configuration, will be active at next reload
0x2102- tells the the router to look into NVRAM for the boot sequence to see where to get ios from
boot system ?- shows the different options of booting your ios
boot system flash c2800nm-adsecurityk9-mz.151-4.M6.bin- boot specific ios, by default it is first ios found in flash
boot system tftp c2800nm-adsecurityk9-mz.151-4.M6.bin 10.1.1.1- boots next from tftp server
boot system rom- boots mini-ios from rom as last resort
using the 3 previous commands all. The system will apply them in order boot file from flash. If fails from tftp. If fails mini-ios rom
do show run | include boot system- show you the order in which the system will take for the boot process.

___boot/startup choices____
____DHCP______
ip dhcp pool Accounting-create a pool
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10;    1.1 gateway  rest for servers
ip dhcp pool Accounting- after exclusion get back into dhcp configuration

default-router 192.168.1.1
dns-server 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8
lease 3 12 15   # careful to not run too long and run out of ip addresses
option 66 ascii tftp.jeffsplace.com
conf t; interface fa0/1; ip helper-address 10.10.10.224; - this will make router listen on fa0/1 for dhcp b-cast and send unicast
dhcp to the server 10.10.10.224
show ip dhcp binding- shows hosts that have a binding ip, used to verify system is working
show ip dhcp pool Accounting-obvious
show ip dhcp server statistics- shows alot of stats
show ip dhcp conflict- shows any address that has had a conflict and dhcp is no longer using. Maybe static ip caused this.
dhcp discover(broadcast)|offer|DHCP request| DHCP ack where all additional info sent ie dns,gate,options
With multiple pools for multiple lans how does the central server no how to server which pool to which host. Depending on which
lan you come from the router will tag your request and relay it to server 
sh run | section dhcp
Relay configuration is a helper address
Router(config-if)ip helper-address 10.1.52.100 # from interface that dhcp request comes from routed to subnet of server

_____dhcp__________
___LOGGING______
logging goes to buffer and console by default.
logging console- logging goes to console! annoying/ no nevermind eventful notification messages. no logging console
logging buffered- stores your logging info, no logging buffered
logging sync- stops logging from breaking up your command line typing
no logging console-Stops the logging being posted while your logged in."Awesine for LABS!!! You don't want to cheat your self
on some good trouble shooting by the logging being printed to console and basically giving away the problem.
no logging buffered-
sh logging- shows logging buffered info
logging host 172.16.10.1- sends log to a sys log server
logging informational- logging at the severity level of 6
logging trap ?- shows logging options, trap will limit the logging sent to syslog server
logging trap informational- same as logging trap 6
no service timestamps- takes away time stamps from logging
service sequence-numbers- turns on sequence number of logging
service timestamps log datetime msec- log with time stamp
terminal monitor- to see logging when your are telneted in to device
sh logging- to see the buffered logging information
how the log is displayed can have multiple different options
no service timestamps- will not time stamp the logging
service sequence-numbers- will add the sequence number to the log
sequence/date:facility ie %SYS severity ie -4-:Mnemonic CONFIG_I: Description configured from console by console

_____logging______
____NTP___
Master:
switch(config)#ntp server pool.ntp.org - your master needs a server right... havent tested any of these configs yet
switch(config)#feature ntp- turning the feature on
switch(config)#ntp master []- in the [] the stratum number goes
switch(config)#ntp authentification-key 42 md5 aNicekey   -creates the key
switch(config)#ntp trusted key 42	-key needs to be trusted for use in ntp packets
switch(config)#ntp authentification; write mem  *** save configs!!!
switch(config)#ntp source 10.100.100.10 -creates the source ip for ntp to use
Client:
switch(config)#conf t; ntp server 10.100.100.10 key 42
switch(config)#show ntp peers- will show you peers and servers
switch(config)#ntp authentification-key 42 md5 aNicekey
switch(config)#show ntp authentification-keys  # verify that your key is there and correct
switch(config)#ntp trusted-key 42    -once again make sure key is trusted so system will use it in ntp transmissions
switch(config)#show ntp trusted-keys	-verify its there
switch(config)#ntp authenticate		-
switch(config)#show ntp authentification-status
_____
ntp server 172.16.10.1 version 4- sets 172... to ntp server- you want one centralized server for acurate time to all devices
sh ntp status- shows ntp status
sh ntp associations- shows ntp information including the ntp server address
#clock set 9:51:00 sep 5 2017-sets the software clock
>calendar set hh:mm:ss day month year -sets hardware clock manually
stratum value for servers is from 1 to 15, a stratum value of 16 means no time updates
staratum 0 most accurate time, stratum 1 gets time from them, stratum 2 and so on
clock timezone California -480   # minutes offset from UTC   need time zone set for NTP server
could use pool.ntp.org

__ntp___
___CDP____  Cisco proprietary
sh cdp- shows you sending cdp interval, holdtime, if it is enabled or not.
cdp ?-  shows you the options to use with cdp
cdp holdtime ____- length of time that receiver must hold cdp packets
cdp timer ___- rate at which cdp packets are sent
cdp run- turn on cdp
no cdp run- obviouse
sh cdp neighbor- shows cdp information for neighboring devices only connected layer 2 devices that are directly connected.
sh cdp neighbor detail- includes iso system is running and ip address amongst other details
important to rememeber local interface, directly connected to host machine here. The neighbors port used is port ID

____cdp_____
____LLDP____Link Layer Discovery Protocol 802.1AB IEEEE standard. Also detects linux servers!
lldp run- turns it on for device
no lldp run- obviouse
device(config-if)#lldp transmit- must be turned on also for each interface to transmit lldp
device(config-if)#lldp receive- lsitens for lldp
lldp show neighbor- shows you the results

____lldp____
____HOST-TABLE____  like local DNS name to ip on a local table
ip host SW-2 10.10.10.2
ip host SW-3 10.10.10.3
do show hosts- shows you your permanent ip host table and temporary names resolved by DNS 
if you do not use the ip domain-name jeffrey.com, the domain is not appended to host name
so ping sw2 , is actually looking up sw2 in dns or host table
when ip domain-name is set  ping sw2 actually looks up sw2.jeffrey.com it appends single hostnames to your domain   

____host-table____
___DNS____
ip domain-lookup- on by default,
ip name-server 8.8.4.4-
ip domain-name jeffsdomain.com- allows you to use hostname as subdomain and appends it to this domain so searching server1 would resolve
server1.jeffsdomain.com - not a big issue to type out the full name anyways.

___dns___
___TOOLS___
ping 192.168.1.1
ping - gives you added features if used without the ip and allows to use a loopback as the from ip, test routing, from non connected int
traceroute 192.168.1.1- uses ttl to give you detailed route from you to destination notating every router
traceroute- as ping it gives you added features if you leave ip space blank
tracert -d 10.0.5.2# speeds it up doesn't look for hostnames, windows command obviously

___tools____
___DEBUG___
debug ?
debug all- debugs everything, and it is also highest priority so routing and switching features secondary. Do not use, could crash.
debug ip icmp- gives you detailed info when you ping

___debug___
___PROCESSES____
sh processes- gives you a read out like a linux top command
sh cpu

___processes____
____Router-Config____
erase startup-config- whole command must be typed up or you will get incomplete command safety mechanism
reload- reload with no config file
conf t; hostname remoterouter; en secret mypass; no ip domain-lookup; int s0/0/0; desc WAN connection to datacenter;
ip address 172.16.10.2 255.255.255.252 same as /30 only two hosts for security;no shut; clock rate 1000000;int f0/0;desc sf lan

password telnet; login; banner motd C This is the sf branch C; copy run start or write mem; sh run or sh run | begin int;
show ip route

_____router-config_____
____STATIC-ROUTE_____
when a router has to look up the routing table for every single packet it is called process switching
ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.4 150 10 or          ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 s0/0/0 exit interface traffic has to be on
that subnet
remote networking, mask, next hop, administrative distance	using exit interface as next hop
in no communication with next-hop route will not show up on table, use permanent parameter to maintain the route until it is live
ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.4 150 permanent name Routetodestination? need name test?
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.10.5-   any network with any mask go to 172.16.10.6- set up default gateway
ip default-gateway - another way to assign the gateway

____static-route___
____FLOATING___
secondary route with higher administrative distance. Will only be used if primary route goes down.
the float will not be listed on routing table, only routes being used, only most efficient are used
 sh run | i ip route  will show you all routes including your floates
two paths with same AD will load balance

____Floating_____
____Dynamic-Routing  RIP____
conf t; router rip; network 10.0.0.0; network 172.16.0.0; version 2; no auto-summary, no route aggregation.
conf t;router rip; default-information originate  -sends the default gateway to the remote networks
network command tells rip what networks to advertise and what interfaces to send advertisments out of
really easy to do but with a really small network the routing table updates really isn't necessary.
router rip; passive-interface Fa0/1- allows the interface to get rip updates but does not send any
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 fa0/0- if you had a Metro-Ethernet connection this would be the gateway to the internet
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.99.99.99    -i prefor next hop as configuration
ip default-gateway 10.99.99.99
default-information originate- generates a default route into RIP
sh ip protocols

___dynamic-routing____
___Serial____
show controllers s0/1
clock rate 64000- is in bits per second 64k bits per second

___serial
___Vlan_____
OLDERWAY FOR OLDER IOS you may come into contact with
vlan database-changes mode to vlan
vlan 50 name vlan50; show vlan brief- to verify vlan is in database
NEWERWAY
conf t;vlan 50; name vlan50 Sales-create vlan
conf t; switchport mode access; switchport access vlan 150; if vlan 150 does not exist its ok switch creates vlan
which also means that a typo will create a vlan for you so pay attention to feedback from monitor!
conf t; switchport mode access; switchport access vlan 3; switchport voice vlan 5- assigns port to a vlan 3 and voice 5
(config-vlan)#name ciscovlan; do show vlan brief;- some switches will show the info here some will not you need to exit first odd behavior.
Just exit then check
show vlan
no vlan 48
no interface vlan 48

____vlan___
___TRUNK___
conf t; int range fa0/15-18;switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q; switchport mode trunk;- create trunk on a range of ports
encapsulation type has to be chosen first to have a dedicated trunking port
switchport mode dynamic desireable- will initiate trunk and listen!
sh interfaces trunk- shows you your trunked interfaces
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,150,200-220;limiting vlans allowed on trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan add 99
switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 7-9
switchport trunk native vlan 150- changes the native vlan. native vlan not tagged, all trunks must have the same native. Native is the 
untagged vlan
switchport negotiate- turns on dtp, abilility to negotiate a trunk
switchport nonegotiate- switchport will not negotiate- turns dtp off. Less overhead, less badnwidth consumption
^ If you set a trunk and encapsulation, system still runs dynamic trunking protocol
You don't want to run DTP people can add trunks where not supposto or software on a ccomputer and hop vlans
also if on a redundant link negotiation takes a while to set up nonegotiate and both sides set to trunk is faster. Line
comes right up with no negotiations needed and less traffic that is not needed.
show interface trunk

___trunk____
____RouterOnAStick_____ multiple vlans trunked into a router where router has sub interfaces for encapsulation, 
conf t; int fa0/0; ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.240;no shutdown- first main interface with subs to follow, main interface not needed
conf t; int fa0/0.2; enscapsulation dot1q 2; ip address 192.168.10.129 255.255.255.240- sub interface vlan2
conf t; int fa0/0.3; encapsulation dot1q 3; ip address 192.168.10.46 255.255.255.240- sub interface vlan3
conf t; int fa0/0.10; encapsulation dot1q 10; ip address 192.168.10.17 255.255.255.240- sub interface vlan 10
vlan 1 is the natvie vlan there for does not need encapsulation by default- this can be changed to any vlan

___routeronastick___
___Layer2-Genreal-knowledge____
When a switch recieves a frame and it does not have the mac address of the destination it will send that frame out every port that is active
except the port it recieved it on. Even if there are 5 ports that it knows the mac address in the cam, it still floods all ports.
Switch has 3 main goals: learning- from the source mac, filtering- creating datalinks between two hosts, loop avoidance STP.

____Port-SecurityL2____
you must enable port security on interface with: switchport port security- then you can do the same command with variables
conf t; int fa1/0/1; switchport mode access; switchport port security; switchport port security ?   shows you your options for security
dynamic desireable- port security will not work, must be hard coded access or trunk. Wouldn't use for trunk so access.
Default port secuirty is violation shutdown with one allow-able mac, default hold time for a mac in the cam is 300 seconds
shutdown- shuts down the port upon violation no access for any mac address
protect- if limited to one it will not allow any others
restrict- same thing as protect but it also logs it for the admin. And counts port security violations
switchport port-security maximum 1- ensures only one host per port
switchport port-security violation shutdown- shutsdown the port if a violation occurs...protect,restrict,shutdown are the options here
to undo a shutdown port- go into port config, shutdown; no shutdown;- should resolve the port
switchport port-security mac-address sticky- mac address table will keep the mac address and not discard after a period of time

___Standard-ACL___range 0-99&1300-1999, list solely based on source ip no ipc6 support
If there is one item in an acl there is an implicit deny for everything else. That is why a permit any is needed unless you want everything 
blocked
when reading access list as soon as match is made action is taken, unlike routing which reads entire table.
Standard acl only uses source ip address,lower processor utilization
1 ACL per direction, per interface, per protocol. applied as close to the destination as possible(standard only)
access-list 10;R1(config-std-acl)#deny host 1.1.1.1;permit any- example from inside acl config
access-list 10 deny host 172.16.0.1;access-list 10 permit any;access-list 10 remark deny 1 host access- remark notes on ACL
access-list 10 deny 172.16.0.1 0.0.0.0; same as above first command signifies one host
int fa0/1;ip access-group 10 out- the host will not be able to go out the fa0/1 basically not allowing him access to the subnet
NAMED: ip access-list standard SalesBlockerweb;deny 172.19.0.0 0.0.255.255;permit any;
permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255- same as permit any
 conf t; int fa0/2;ip access-group SalesBlockerweb out- 
access-list 10 deny 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255- blocks the whole class B range 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.254
You can only remove one line of a access list if it is named-non named access list you can not remove specific lines
ALso you can only get to the sw2(config-std-nacl) prompt if it is a named acl standard you have to write full command
the access list will show sequence numbers. They are in blocks of 10s starting at ten, you can use the numbers
to add new items on the list or to no one of the items out.
ip access-list standard InternetBlocker;15 deny 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255- adds this item to line 15
ip access-list standard InternetBlocker;no 15- takes away that item
sh run int fa1/0/1- easiest way to see access lists applied and direction
sh ip int vlan2 - shows alot of info including access-list and direction, previous command is preferred quicker reading and direction
VLAN ACL
sh access-list
sh access-list 20
10 deny 10.1.3.5
20 permit any
sender 10.1.3.5 recipient 10.1.2.5
int vlan 2; access-group 20 out; response packet filtered from sender, reccipient did not recieve echo request
reasoning:When packet goes out packet is filtered and never gets to host
int vlan 2; access-group 20 in; no change data transmits freely
reasoning:packet is filtered inbound so when sender sends packet source ip is 10.1.3.5, recipient returns echo reply and source ip is 
10.1.2.5
so when filtering occurs source ip has changed and then it does not match filtering deny
So with VLANS you can think of outbound the same as if on a port out is out the ports and in is back in the ports

If you ever plan on changing things and moving things around use a named acl easier to manipulate
also if you add in remarks the remark will be directly after your last applied acl line if you just applied a new line to the acl
if you are editing an acl adding in lines then you place a remark I have had some odd behavior not as expected also this is with older

___ACL-ON-terminal-lines____
ip access-list standard jeff- create a standard access list called jeff
access-list 50 permit 172.16.0.1 0.0.3.255- access list that permits 172.16.0.1-172.16.3.254- so it denies all other ips
line vty 0 15- this allow me to configure the vty lines
access-class 50 in- inbound traffic on the router for terminal access, maybe only allow admin subnet
___acl-on-terminal-lines____
____Extended-ACL___range 100-199&2000-2699 [supports ipv6- but for modifying you can only rm line or add a line only to end.]
apply exteneded access lists as close to the source as possible

Named:ip access-list extended BlockSales- you get a prompt where you dont need to say access-lift name/number just start at deny or permit
sh ip interface fa0/1 - to see access-list applied to interface and which direction it is applied
sh access-lists- shows you all your access-lists on the system, but not where or how they are applied
sh ip access-list- shows only ip access-lists
sh access-list 110- shows you only the parameters of the access-list
when you view the access lists they are sequenced by groups of ten so you can add things inbetween them if you wish
access-list 110 19 remark add a line on line 19 that tells you about line 20, so when you read it you get it!
access-list 110 21 deny tcp host 10.0.0.50 host 172.16.50.5 eq 21- add a line after 20 sequence because it relates to that line
ip access-list extended 110;21 deny tcp host 10.0.0.50 host 172.16.50.5 eq 21- same as above

____Reflexive-ACL____
Reflexive is Stateful access list, allows return traffic based on outgoing traffic. Only allows traffic incoming for that session.
The standard and extended access lists are stateless. Traffic going out does not open firewall for return traffic

____IPv6____
(config)sdm prefer dual-ipv4-and-ipv6 default- allow ipv6 routing on the switch
(config)ipv6 unicast-routing- enables ipv6 on a router
2851 you need advanced ip services adventerprises
fe80::/10 link local communication on local lan
2000::/3 global unicast isp gives you /48 you have /48-/64 for all your subnets. last 64/host addresses
fc00::/unique local deprecated but some say active. Locally private routed addresses, not necessary because no nat is needed.
FF00::/8 multicast
ff02::2		Router solicitation from host to router
ff02::1   Router advertisement
::1- localhsot test pinging your nic
[H1]FF02::2->-RS->---------<--FF02::1--<-RA---[R1] USe me
(config-if)ipv6 address 2001:db8:3c4d:1:260:d6FF:FE73:1987/64- complete address
(config-if)ipv6 address 2001:db8:3c4d:1::/64 eui-64- extended unique identifier uses mac and pad to build rest of the addy, FFFE sits right
in the middle of the mac to give it its full length and the seventh bit changes weather it is local or globally unique
(config-if)ipv6 address 2001:db8:3c4d:1::22/64-host address all zeros with 22 at end
(config-if)ipv6 enable- uses only link local address. Meaning communicate only on subnet no routing
(config-if)ipv6 address autoconfig default-Listens for RAs and will autoconfig once it gets one, default injects default route received from
RA
(config-if)ipv6 address autoconfig- no default route needed to be injected to interface

ipv6 route ::/0 s0/0/1- create a default route
do sh ipv6 route- confirm connected interfaces are showing and link address
do sh ipv6 route static- confirm connected interfaces are showing and link address
sh ipv6 int brief- same as ip
sh run int fa 1/0/6- you can run a show run on config of one int
ping ipv6 2001:db8:3C4D:12:21A:2FFF:FEE7:4398
____Spanning-Tree Protocol_____
(config-if)spanning-tree portfast- makes it so port does not wait for spanning tree, comes right up
show spanning-tree summary-shows you switch spanning tree mode, and how many blocking and forwarding ports
show spanning-tree vlan 10-
show spanning-tree active- show you which port is active and alternates
show spanning-tree detail-detailed
____spanning-tree protocol_____
____VTP____Vlan trunk protocol- reduces administration, onyl works over trunking ports
Switches can be a server(clients follows suit),client(obviouse),transparent(relays, but does not apply)
version 2 supports token ring vlans, version 1 does not.
vtp mode server-maker you a server
vtp domain ccna-all switches in this domain will communicate via vtp
vtp password cisco-creates a vtp password
do sh vtp password- will show you your vtp password
vtp version 2- use vtp version 3
vtp mode clinet- makes you a client
vtp password cisco- you need to put the password in for each machine
vtp mode transparent-
do sh vtp status-
Cisco recommends do not use! Keep individual vtp database on each machine(Maybe use for setup and then shutdown).
People can forget to remove the vlan.dat of a switch that is also a vtp server that is entered into the environment,
over writes all your vlans. Shuts down network until you correct vlans with higher revision number on server
no vtp off mode, vtp transparent is the option.
Every switch can be a server. Just means they all have the ability to modify vlan database
Client can not modify, makes changes and passes it on. Transparent does not make changes just passes info on
Highest revision number takes control of vlans. That can be the problem but thats how it also passes through net
you can delete your config but forget to change your vlan.dat which has all your vlans and revision number

___vtp_____
___Iperf____
Check speed from client to server. Verify speeds through your network if speed to internet seem questionable
iperf3 -s  #listening mode as server from directory containing iperf
iperf3.exe -c 10.1.2.10    # ip is servers ip

____iperf____
___NAT____
Overload NAT- PAT- translates internal ip and port number to external ip and port number(same port if available)
Two inside hosts use the same port number using Nat overload. Nat/Pat is designed to solve this problem by translating
using the next available port number. So your internal port number will be the same but your global will be next available
so when traffic comes back to router pat will translate back to your original port number, though it used another available port.
Kind of like port forwarding using two different port numbers
You can use static nat to translate an ip address to specific internal ip without it being assigned to interface.
Say you purchase a secondary ip for your location. Both ips can be used by isp to route to you one for
pat and all internet traffic and secondary forwards to internal ip (webserver)without even being assigned to interface.(static nat)
when you saturate a public ip you would want to use a pool. Dynamic NAT

Static Nat configuration
interface Ethernet0l;ip address 10.1.1.10 255.255.255.0;ip nat inside- just identifying the interface as inside for the one translation
interface Serial0;ip address 170.46.2.2 255.255.255.0; ip nat outside- just idntifying the interface as outside for the one translation
ip nat inside source static 10.1.1.1 170.46.2.2;- one to one specific

for web
ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.1.161 80 200.1.1.11 80
also known as port forwarding, come in on this port and translate to this can be used with different ports also.

Dynamic Nat configuration
interface Ethernet0;ip address 10.1.1.10 255.255.255.0; ip nat inside-
interface Serial0;ip address 170.168.2.1 255.255.255.0; ip nat outside-
ip nat pool mypool 170.168.2.3 170.168.2.8 netmask 255.255.255.0- indicates the pool
ip nat pool mypool 170.168.2.3 170.168.2.8 prefix-length 24-
access-list 1 permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255- when traffic meets this ACL its pulled into the nat process
ip nat inside source list 1 pool mypool-translate address that match the access-list to an address from the pool jeff
append to above : type rotary; rotates addresses to create a type of nat load balancing, rotary rotates!

during boot  ctrl+break ; special break option in putty; ctrl pause/break....rommon 1 > configuration-register 0x2142;reload
en;copy start run; en secret fhdshfdsjkfhskjd;write mem; copy run start
all interfaces will be shutdown after copy start run. The config does not have no shut as a command, routers down by default
int fa1/0; no shut
int s1/0/1; no shut
configuration-register 0x2102 
switches can not change configuration register, so you will use the button on the front bottom that gets you to a switch: prompt
dir; dir flash:; rename flash:/config.text flash:/config.old; reload
Now when the system boots it will not read the config file due to the name being changed
en; copy config.old running-config; enable secret newpass;write mem; delete flash:/config.old
