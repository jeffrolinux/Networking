____CAM_____ Content Addresable Memory  - mac address-table layer 2 movements
show mac address-table; you can use many switches [dynamic, static, vlan, int]
show mac address-table count; display current cam table length
mac address-table static mac-address vlan vlan-id int fa 1/0/48;
clear mac address-table dynamic mac-address int fa 1/0/48 vlan vlan-id;

____TCAM_____ Ternary Content-Addressable Memory -  Ternary just stands for 3 -VMR
two tcams one for ACL and one for Qos ACL
show platform tcam utilization;
show tcam counts; monitor utilization of tcam and lous
show platform hardware capacity acl;
show tcam lou;
Value-134 bit and holds--->protocol,Tos, source, src port, s port lou, dest, dest port,d port lou
Mask-
Result- permit or deny
each mask has a dest mask and source and for that pairing there can be 8 entries in that section
LOU- logical operation unit- lt-less than, gt-greater than, eq-equal to, neg-not equal to, range
if you run out of lou space done in hardware you can expand this to be done in software
It is NOT correct to directly correlate number of ACEs configured to number of masks/entries used.
As you might be aware, an ACL and the TCAM are order dependent. For 2 ACEs to share the same mask
besides having the don’t care bits in the same locations they need to be adjacent to each other in the ACL definition.
Example:
permit any host 192.168.10.0;permit any host 192.168.10.1;- this can be represented by one tcam entry
Permit 192.10.10.0 255.255.255.254

____SDM_____ - Switching Database Manager  manages partition sizes for efficient switching
show sdm prefer
sdm prefer tempplate; template will be of your choosing ie default,access,vlan,routing 
sizes are much smaller while dual stacking ipv4 and ipv6
