Why does cdp work with misconfigured native vlan and what is happening.
Switch A native vlan 3, Switch B native vlan 6. Device traffic uses the native vlan and native vlan is untagged so
basically switch a non tagged vlan traffic can hop on over to switch B vlan 6 which is also non tagged across trunk
Basically you don't want traffic hopping vlans at layer 2, thats what inter vlan routing is for.
VTP domain mismatch will not allow trunks to come up through negotiation, or if static trunk, trunk will
come up but vtp information will not be propogated.

____CAM_____ Content Addresable Memory  - mac address-table layer 2 movements
show mac address-table; you can use many switches [dynamic, static, vlan, int]
show mac address-table count; display current cam table length
mac address-table static mac-address vlan vlan-id int fa 1/0/48; add a stiatic address in the cam table
clear mac address-table dynamic mac-address int fa 1/0/48 vlan vlan-id; remove a specific entry in cam
to change the size of the mac address table you need to use sdm

____TCAM_____ Ternary Content-Addressable Memory -  Ternary just stands for 3 -VMR
two tcams one for ACL and one for Qos ACL
show platform tcam utilization;
show tcam counts; monitor utilization of tcam and lous
show platform hardware capacity acl;
show tcam lou;
Value-134 bit and holds--->protocol,Tos, source, src port, s port lou, dest, dest port,d port lou
Mask-
Result- permit or deny
each mask has a dest mask and source and for that pairing there can be 8 entries in that section
LOU- logical operation unit- lt-less than, gt-greater than, eq-equal to, neg-not equal to, range
if you run out of lou space done in hardware you can expand this to be done in software
It is NOT correct to directly correlate number of ACEs configured to number of masks/entries used.
As you might be aware, an ACL and the TCAM are order dependent. For 2 ACEs to share the same mask
besides having the donâ€™t care bits in the same locations they need to be adjacent to each other in the ACL definition.
Example:
permit any host 192.168.10.0;permit any host 192.168.10.1;- this can be represented by one tcam entry
Permit 192.10.10.0 255.255.255.254
Defining logical operations in ACL to optimize usage of TCAM/LOUs
if you run out of lou you should just state specifics lets say we want Permit any host 192.10.10.1 tcp range 1020 1023 any 
and we can not use more hardware lous then we
Permit any host 192.10.10.1 tcp 1020 any; Permit any host 192.10.10.1 tcp 1021 any; Permit any host 192.10.10.1 tcp 1022 any; Permit any host 192.10.10.1 tcp 1023 any
attempt to reuse lous already created for other ACE when possible

____SDM_____ - Switching Database Manager  manages partition sizes for efficient switching
show sdm prefer
sdm prefer tempplate; template will be of your choosing ie default,access,vlan,routing 
sizes are much smaller while dual stacking ipv4 and ipv6
If your switch does not have ipv6 commands change the sdm template to ipv4-ipv6 dual stack
