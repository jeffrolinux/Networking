THIS SEGMENT IS FOR USING NETCAT TO PRINT A FILE USING A HP PRINTER
telnet printerIP      ie    telent 10.18.68.143
at the prompt the / will give lots of information about the printer
if printer supports postscript install a2ps or anyother tool to convert file to postscript actually doing it:
a2ps myasciifile.txt -o mypsfile.ps  # takes ascii file and converts to postscript
You need to know the port the printer your working with is listening on
cat mypsfile.ps | nc 10.14.15.16 9100
___________
Another way to do this
nc 10.14.15.16 9100
hello
world
ctrl-c
The formatting will be off in the printer output
You can embed carriage returns in a file as such
in Vim
Shift A - from command mode puts you in special insert mode
ctrl-v - tells vim next key should be input literally
enter
File with embeded carriage return
